# Technique

It's important in any craft to study tecnique

For instance, I just implemented ***nested*** syntax in my ***```very fancy system```***


This *obviously* **feels** ***very nice, and makes me feel ```print("things and stuff)```***, so lets have a look at how it works




```python
hello = "hellow world"
print(hello)
print("I have become dead from boredom while studying management")
```

Managers aren't real people. Just ask them
