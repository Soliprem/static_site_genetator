# Static Site Generator

This is a guided project from the awesome [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Capabilities

The generator is pretty rudimentary and simple. It handles nested syntax, and it won't break if a language is specified through the syntax ```\`\`\`python```. However, no fancy syntax highlighting. It'd take *way* too much CSS.

This is an example page of what can be generated
